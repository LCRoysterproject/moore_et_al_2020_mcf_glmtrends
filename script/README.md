This is the `script` folder outline. The `script` folder will include all scripting code files. 
  
### Naming Standards  
Every script is required to be in lowercase, no uppercase (camelcase) nor all caps, all names with separate words need to include a underscore ( _ ) and **no spaces**, no dates in the names unless it helps with the descriptions of the content (i.e., discharge_1941_2018_quantile.R, landings_1986_2018_analysis.R). Script file names should be descriptive and concise. Scripts that have a single ouput should be named in a similar fashion to its filetype output.  
  
If there are more than 10 different scripts, categorize them by applicable folders. This is **NOT** normal for one individual repository project.  
  
Optional folder examples:  

- data_figure  
- analysis  
- map  
- simulation
